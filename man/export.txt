[bold][magenta]## chocolate export[/magenta][/bold]
-> This function is used to export the project into a zip file.
- Use `-o <output file>` to specify the output file.
- Use `-a` to export the entire folder (see the attachment).
- Use `-w` to avoid exporting the .chocolate file (not recommended).

[bold]Attachment:[/bold] By default, the export function only exports the files and folders that are in the path. Run `chocolate path -h` to get help with adding or removing paths from the project.
